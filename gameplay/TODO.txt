DONE
2 Brake lines removed after using WLO to clear the lineover
- Brake stowing
2 More info after jump: depl. altitude, freefall time, canopy time, jump number.
2 Better first person view

EASY
3 MrGparpinelli's camera angles

NORMAL
- RSL choice (none, standard, skyhook) (automatic reserve deployment on main cutaway)
2 Freefly carving
- Fully functional wingsuit physics

HARD
- Different aerodynamic characteristic suits (loose, tight, thermal, freefly, etc)
- Swoop meter
- More malfunctions: Pilot chute hesitation, horseshoe, baglock, lineover, toggle failure (due to age of eq).
- PLF landing
- More realistic deployment sequence
- Custom mission creator
- Acrobatic airplane exits.
- All acrobatic jumps that have animations
- Completely rewritten freefall (including wingsuit) physics engine v.2.0

BRING IT ON
- Location creation/import (maybe just the Dam level or Ramosch for now)
